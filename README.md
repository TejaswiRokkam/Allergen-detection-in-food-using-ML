# Allergen-detection-in-food-using-ML
-Food allergies affect millions, and accidental exposure to allergens can cause severe health risks, but identifying
allergens in packaged or prepared foods is often difficult due to unclear labeling or cross-contamination.
-SafeBite uses AI to analyze ingredient labels accurately detecting the presence of allergens, and empowering
users to make safer food choices.
-Uses multiple machine learning algorithms to detect allergens from food products, ensuring accurate classification
and improved safety. Built with Python Flask for backend API development and Streamlit for an interactive
and user-friendly frontend.
